      <h5 class="my-2">Modak Joins Starburst Partner Program to Create Domain-Driven Data Products based on a Data Mesh Architecture</h5>
      <p>Modak, a leading provider of data engineering solutions, today announced they have joined the Starburst Orbit partner program. This partnership will empower organizations to manage their siloed data landscape, optimize cloud operating costs and accelerate the creation of domain-specific data products accessed through a data mesh architecture.</p><br/>
      <p>“The partnership will empower organizations to transition from centralized to decentralized data processing and de-couple compute from storage. The unique value proposition will fast-track the creation of contextual business data domain products at reduced time and operational costs,” says Milind Chitgupakar, Chief Analytics Officer, and co-founder, at Modak.</p><br/>
      <p>“We’re delighted to have Modak join our partner program to deliver their unique expertise to the pharmaceutical and healthcare market. Starburst is allowing companies to unlock the value of their data by making it fast and easy to access, no matter where it lives, without data movement. We are excited to help our customers bring a more personalized experience to their customers, patients, partners and to build data into their core business,” says Tony Li, Global Head of SIs at Starburst Data.</p><br/>
      <p>Enterprise Data Management has evolved, from data warehouses to data lakes, and now to multimodal cloud architecture. All these data architecture models have undergone evolutionary enhancements. But, despite all advancements, some things remain unchanged. Data management architecture and technology are still monolithic, and data remains centralized.</p><br/>
      <p>There is a need for a decentralized data management architecture that allows for easier access to data across different data domains, i.e., through a Data Mesh. The fundamental concept behind data mesh architecture is to transfer data ownership to the business owners and users who create the data. Operationally, the Data mesh architecture allows organizations to treat “data as products”, just like software applications, rather than fragmented data sets centrally managed by IT.</p><br/>
      <p>With Modak’s digital accelerators, such as Modak Nabu™ and Starburst’s enterprise-ready, powerful query engine, organizations will be able to create contextual business data domain products accessible through APIs and will move to federated data governance and self-service analytics capabilities.</p><br/>
      <p>Modak recently enabled a Top 5 pharma company to productionize six domain data products within months, using cloud and data mesh architecture. The six domain data products are now accessible to thousands of users across the enterprise.</p><br/>
