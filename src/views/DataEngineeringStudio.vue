      <h3 class="text-navy leading-tight">MODAK DATA ENGINEERING STUDIO™</h3>
      <p>We're all familiar with "Movie Studios" - a place where stories are choreographed with pre-assembled sets, immersive CGI animations, and talented actors, all working together to create films that entertain and captivate us. Every year, as new scripts are filmed, edited, and distributed, a typical movie studio set is reused and changed out for multiple films. Modak leveraged this concept in developing its own ‘Data Engineering Studio’, a pre-set, tested and proven methodology, software, and processes to where Enterprise customers can transform their data journeys from silos to value-driven-data assets. for enterprise data orchestration.</p><br/>
      <p>In this blog, we’ll walk you through our groundbreaking concept to deliver best-in-class data products for business consumption and explain why we believe Modak’s Data Engineering Studio ™ will revolutionize data engineering forever.</p><br/>
      <p>For the first time, Modak's Data Engineering Studio ™ has captured the learnings from decades of experience, hundreds of projects and thousands of data pipelines and packaged these into one cohesive methodology., providing enterprise data teams a brand-new set of pre-packaged, tested, and proven methodologies, tools, training, integrations, and practices that enable Enterprises to build continuous data flywheels.</p><br/>
      <p>Modak’s Data Engineering Studio™ bridges the gap between analytical, business, IT infrastructure, data platform and data processing teams build on industry standard Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe™). Accelerating the delivery of federated data domain for consumption by analytical teams and AI. Furthermore, the studio approach ensures continuous delivery of data products as a service, monitoring, and skilled managed service teams to institutionalize a DataOps culture.</p>
      <p>With Modak Data Engineering Studio™ enterprises can easily implement Modern Data Platforms that are innovation ready and support large digital transformation efforts. Modak provides the best-in-class templates, tools, processes, expertise, and data domain knowledge to enable data orchestration across cloud provider. The capabilities provided by Modak’s Data Engineering Studio™ are enabled by Modak Nabu ™, an intelligent data orchestration platform.</p><br/>

      <h5 class="text-modak-blue">DIGITAL ACCELERATORS FOR A MODERN DATA PLATFORM</h5>
      <p>A Modern Data Platform is a new architectural pattern for data management. Modern Data Platform provides an automated data infrastructure that continuously feeds analytical models and AI algorithms, through standardized data products that evolve as more data is fed into them – hence the “data flywheel” analogy. One of the tenets of a modern data platform is a focus on the entire source data landscape and tackling multiple use cases versus the traditional approach of limiting to project-level or functional level requirements.</p><br/>
      <p>Modak Nabu™ allows enterprises to automate data ingestion, profiling, and curation tasks. Modak Nabu™ joins multiple heterogeneous datasets and creates a data fabric which enables data lake creation. Once data has been profiled, Modak Nabu™ allows domain driven data products to be curated through data mesh framework build on Workspaces. We believe that data fabric and mesh should operate together and not as independent approaches.</p><br/>
      <p>Let’s understand the core elements of a modern data platform:</p><br/>
      <p>a) Data Fabric</p><br/>
      <p>The data fabric provides the data services from the source data through to the delivery of data products, aligning well with the first and second elements of the modern data platform architecture. Modak Nabu’s Data Fabric provides a “net” that is cast to stitch together multiple heterogeneous data sources and types, through automated data pipelines that proliferate an active metadata repository.</p><br/>
      <p>b) Data Lake</p><br/>
      <p>A data lake is a central repository that enables you to store all of your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Modak Nabu’s automated data pipelines accelerate the data ingestion process and reduce the time required for data lake creation.</p><br/>
      <p>c) Data Mesh</p><br/>
      <p>Data mesh aims to connects the two planes of operational and analytical data sets and deliver business-owned data products with a lifecycle (just as software) and consumed through APIs. Modak Nabu delivers domain driven data products with data-based principles. These data products are consumed by data and business users.</p>

      <h5 class="text-modak-blue">Summary</h5>
      <p>Let’s circle back to the movie studio analogy- shooting in a studio exponentially simplifies the filmmaking process. It saves time, capital and human resources, and the customizable sets offer great visual appeal. Similarly, Modak’s portfolio of Data Engineering Studio services enables company to prevent resource exploitation and focus on the ‘what’ and ‘why’ to drive business value, rather than pondering and struggling on the ‘how’.</p><br/>
