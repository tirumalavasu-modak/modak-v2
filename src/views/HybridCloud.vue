      <h3 class="text-navy leading-tight">Is your Data Strategy ready for a Multi-Hybrid Cloud Future?</h3>
      <p>Prior to the advent of cloud computing, enterprises had all their data and applications with on-prem data centers
        and hosting providers. To scale, companies had two choices: Expand their existing data center capacity – an
        expensive and time-consuming proposition or expand with hosting providers – again an expensive approach. With
        cloud these inhibitors to scaling, plus the availability of cloud-managed SaaS applications, the growth and
        adoption of cloud computing is exponential. Many enterprises are now referring to these early journeys as Cloud
        1.0 or Cloud 2.0, focused on lift & shift of applications and data from on-prem to the cloud, building secure
        extensions of their private networks and leveraging cloud provider data processing and analytical services.
        However, we now appear to be at an inflexion point, enterprises are coming to the realization that:</p><br />
      <p>(a) Not all workloads will move to the Cloud, research from IBM shows up to 55% of workloads will remain on-prem.
        Why? security, compliance, and investment in large scale on-prem infrastructure which is as cost-effective as
        operating in the Cloud.</p><br />
      <p>(b) The dread of cloud provider unlock in, as cloud providers continue to extend their services and products
        outside of the initial Infrastructure as a Service (compute and storage) to databases, middleware, security etc, a
        plethora of services that are tied to ONE provider and do not interoperate with other cloud providers. Enterprise
        fear of “lock-in” to a cloud provider, once in, impossible to untangle, losing their ability to negotiate reduced
        pricing and inability to benefit from different cloud provider services to drive innovation and reduce cost.</p>
      <br />
      <p>We believe enterprises are now embarking on a cloud 3.0 future, a horizon that requires “interoperability” and
        “orchestration” at the very heart of any strategy and architecture. A future that will require on-prem
        applications and data, to operate across <strong>MULTIPLE</strong> cloud providers, allow Enterprises with
        <strong>optionality and flexibility</strong> to meet their business objectives, and to control the influence and
        dominance of the cloud providers – in our view to take back control!
      </p><br />
      <p>A multi-hybrid cloud strategy provides the freedom to choose multiple cloud service providers based on the data
        workload and end-user requirements. Multi-hybrid cloud strategy provides benefits such as - no vendor lock-in,
        improved data workload management, enhanced data security, and improved ROI with a mix of on-prem data centers and
        multiple different private and public clouds.</p>

    <v-row class="my-4 flex flex-col">
      <h5 class="text-modak-blue">Multi-Cloud:</h5>
      <p>Multi-cloud strategy includes more than one public cloud provider, usually to perform different data and

          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li><strong>Cost Optimization</strong>
              By utilizing multiple cloud providers, enterprises benefit from different pricing options for computing and
              storage resources. Enterprises can allocate IT resources to the most cost-effective provider based on
              storage
              and workload needs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>
              Enterprises can run data workloads in multiple cloud environments as per the specific use case requirements.
              Enterprises can leverage more than one public cloud provider for specific data workloads and optimize
              performance and scalability at controlled costs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Vendor Lock-in</strong>
              One of the topmost priorities of enterprises is to avoid vendor lock-in. If their needs are not met,
              organizations want the freedom to switch cloud service providers. Businesses that use a multi-cloud strategy
              have options and are not restricted to use a single cloud service provider.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong>
              If a vendor experiences an attack or infrastructure downtime, a multi-cloud user can quickly switch to
              another
              cloud service provider or fall back to a private cloud.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Innovation</strong>
              Benefiting from the investments and strengths of each Cloud provider to drive innovation, for example Google
              GCP is recognized as a leader in AI / ML services due to their heritage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>
              Enterprises are concerned about losing control over critical data and applications in the cloud environment.
              In a hybrid cloud strategy enterprise can have an on-prem data center or a private cloud to host their
              critical data or applications to have more security and control over data assets.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Bursting</strong>
              Cloud bursting is a way to manage data workload with a combination of public and private clouds. If an
              enterprise has used the private cloud to its full capacity and there is an increase in data traffic, the
              enterprise can route the access data traffic to the public cloud without any service interruptions. A hybrid
              cloud provides better workload management and cost efficiency with cloud bursting.
